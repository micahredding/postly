	"summary": "Ryan and Micah bring back all former guests of the show, for one massive megazord of an episode. They speak some positive words into your life, talk about how “there are really only like five stories anyway”, delve into the origin of ties, sweatpants in public, and Slipknot, and then see just how deep the rabbit hole goes when they explore books based on movies, based on board games, based on books.",
